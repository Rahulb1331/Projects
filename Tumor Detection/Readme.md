<H1> Tumor Detection Model Comparison </H1>
This project aims to develop a tumor detection model using multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy for tumor detection.
The analysis involves the following steps:<br>
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.<br>
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>
3. Training each machine learning model on the training set.<br>
4. Evaluating the models' performance using accuracy metrics on the testing set.<br>
5. Comparing the accuracy of each algorithm to determine the most effective approach for tumor detection.
