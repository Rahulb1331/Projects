<H1> AirBnB Analysis </H1>
This project involves the creation of a Tableau dashboard that analyzes the AirBnB dataset for New York City. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the dataset, including average prices in different neighborhoods for each room type, total bookings by month and neighborhood group, top 10 hosts by user review, total bookings by neighborhood group and room type, average price in the neighborhood, and more.<BR>

<H1>Car Features Analysis</H1>
This data analysis project aims to explore a dataset related to vehicles, performing EDA and derive meaningful insights from it. The project addresses several analytical questions to uncover insights from the dataset, including:
1. Price Analysis
2. Fuel Efficiency Comparison
3. Popular Vehicle Features
4. Temporal Analysis
5. Market Segmentation
<H1>COVID-19 and World Happiness Report Analysis</H1>
This project aims to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 cases and various factors related to happiness and quality of life using two datasets: one containing information about confirmed COVID-19 cases by country and day, and another containing data from the World Happiness Report. The analysis involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure compatibility between datasets.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions, correlations, and trends.
- Visualization of findings using plots and charts for better understanding.
<H1>Instagram User Analytics</H1>
User analysis is the process used to track how the users engage and react with the digital product and derive business insights for marketing , product and development teams. These derived insights are then used by the teams across the business to launch new marketing campaigns, decide on new features to build for their app, track the success of the app, by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether all along helping the business grow.
In this project insights are provided on the various analytical questions. Questions range from identifying their oldest customers to the most commonly used hashtags. These insights are looked for also on the basis of the Investor metrics to check user engagement and prevent redundency.
<H1> Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike </H1>
Operation Analytics is the analysis done for complete end to end operations of a company. With its help, the company is able to find the areas on which it must improve upon. This kind of analysis is also used to predict the overall growth or decline of a companyâ€™s fortune. It also allows better automation, better understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows.
Investigating metric spike is another important part of operation analytics. It is important to find out different scenarios such as finding out dip in the user engagement, or finding out the dip in sales. In the project insights are provided by us to the different departments. The tasks range from finding out the user growth of a product to calculating the weekly engagement per device to finding out the Email engagement to weekly retention
<H1>Tumor Detection Model Comparison </H1>
This project aims to develop a tumor detection model using multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy for tumor detection. The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Training each machine learning model on the training set.
4. Evaluating the models' performance using accuracy metrics on the testing set.
5. Comparing the accuracy of each algorithm to determine the most effective approach for tumor detection.
