# Projects
1) Speech recognition ivr, when the user calls the extension then an IVR dialplan is played, which accepts the speech (in the form of recording the user's speech input), as well as the digit (DTMF) input. This Ivr is made in Lua language, and this script sends the recording to the NodeJS script which invokes the Google Speech-to-text API, which converts the recorded input to text transcription. After this, the transcription is send back to the Lua script which extracts the keywords from this script and transfers the call to the extension corresponding to the input given. For example, if the user says "I need help with billing" or "billing support" then the customer will be transferred to the extension or number where their billing enquiry will be resolved. This project was done on FreeSWITCH media service, on this media service the dialplans as well as the numbers asscoiated with these dialplans are made, various protocols such as SIP (Session Initiated Protocol), transport protocols such as UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are followed by this media service. 
2) Numbers game, in here we have a 4x4 matrix with numbers between 1-15 occupying random spaces. This random arrangemment of numbers have to be arranged in to a sorted order, with the range starting from 1 and till 15. A limited number of moves are allowed (4) within which the numbers have to be sorted. If the player does so, then he wins otherwise he loses. The player can move only 1 step at a time with the arrow key. He can move numbers at an empty position only and for each valid move the total number of moves will decrease by 1.
3) User analysis is the process used to track how the users engage and react with the digital product and derive business insights for marketing , product and development teams. 
These derived insights are then used by the teams across the business to launch new marketing campaigns, decide on new features to build for their app, track the success of the app, by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether all along helping the business grow. 
In this project insights are provided by us to the product team of Instagram as well as the product manager on the various questions asked by the management. Questions range from identifying their oldest customers to the most commonly used hashtags. These insights are looked for also on the basis of the Investor metrics to check user engagement and prevent redundency.
